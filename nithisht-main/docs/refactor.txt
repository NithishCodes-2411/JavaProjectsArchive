   File: SpressoBot.java, ChickenBot.jaba, AngryBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove()
   Issue Idetified: Common code to check if move will result in 
                    energy use and decrement energyLevel if that 
                    is the case

                        protected method to be used instead.
